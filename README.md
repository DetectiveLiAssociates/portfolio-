## Instruction

- Download ./judge-of-hell

- Place ./judge-of-hell into the same directory level as your main minishell.c ( ./minishell )

- It's because, Judge of Hell will Test-Run your minishell LIVE during the Testing

- The Final Step is >>> RUN:   ./judge-of-hell

## How to Download

- Click the file name above: judge-of-hell

- When a new page opens up, click the 3-Dot Button on the Top-Right side of the screen

- Choose Download

- Once fully-downloaded, check your Downloads/ folder; then move it into your main minishell/ folder

## Technical

- Judge of Hell will provide Rapid Parameter Testing Automation as a helping tool for anyone doing and or (especially) debugging minishell project; since any new code-modification would likely need another recurring rapid code-balancing testings to check if everything remains working right from the square one, something which would be severely time-consuming if ever repetitively done manually; and could possibly leave unprecedented vulnerabilities if some testing parameters get forgotten during the redo.

- Judge of Hell will stress-test your minishell (without mercy) at the seven(7)-Mandatory prerequisite level with 200+ selected parameters, ranging from the simplest single service requests, to the intermediate level - reflecting exhaustive takes inspired by the infamous Dasha's minishell .pdf compilation, and up-to the most recent Extreme Mandatory-level testing parameters created by several generative . Hence, '3-Fire-Icons' does means Super-Spicy - a.k.a - Extreme level.

- Your Minishell Exit Signal will also be tested against the Standard BASH Exit Signal; thus your exit signal must meet the same Standard BASH value.

- Per Seniors' Guidance, BASH STDIN output would not be tested - thus your detour away from any STDIN mode by directing it into Error-Handling mode is appreciated as well.  

- Judge of Hell only test input parameters; and doesn't test your minishell History, the Sorted ENV Variables, CTRL-C, CTRL-D, and CTRL-\ hardware-based input prerequisites - those which must be tested manually on your own.

- Judge of Hell does not test Bonus Level parts; and does not test beyond the scope of the instructed seven(7)-Mandatory Built-ins prerequisites: echo with -n flag, cd, pwd, env, export, unset, exit. Per one Senior's advice, as well as per instruction stated inside the minishell manual .pdf - always do remember that: minishell is just a Mini-Shell, and NOT a Full-Blown Shell.

- At the end of the testing, Judge of Hell would appreciate your minishell performance in a short summary, based on how many successes and fails your minishell did; plus - the projected average percentage(%) score.

- Judge of Hell was packed with 'special' sense of dark humor as part of a relaxing work culture. Feel free to laugh along the way.

- This is where your minishell nightmare meets the real elm-street of the Twilight-Zone!

Cheers!
