## Instruction

- Download ./judge-of-hell

- Place ./judge-of-hell into the same directory level as your main minishell.c ( ./minishell )

- make - your minishell.c into executable ./minishell - using your own Makefile

- It's because, ./Judge of Hell will Test-Drive your minishell **LIVE** during the Testing

- The Final Step is >>> Just CALL 1-800-:   ./judge-of-hell

## FAQ (Frequently Asked Question)

- Q: "Does it need to be in a somekind of folder?"

- A: "NOPE!" - ./judge-of-hell is already a binary file - you don't need to make or to hustle in order to build it anymore; and you don't need to create any 'special' folder for it - at all! - Just place it at the same level with - or - next to where your main ./minishell is - and then run the Judge, by typing: ./judge-of-hell    ...as simple as that - zero fuss.

- Q: "How can I know the performance result of my minishell program?"

- A: "EASY!" - since ./judge-of-hell will Test-Drive and Execute your miniFKNshell LIVE - you can watch how 'your miniFKNshell' performs in-action against each given testing-parameter - In Real-Time - on your screen. Once all completed, you could always review the transparent results in-details by scrolling up your screen.

## Technical

- Each project at 42, the Mandatory Level is the fundamental obligatory level that anyone shall pass prior to the bonus part. No bonus will ever be evaluated if the result of its mandatory level sucks. Thus, mandatory level checking is Critically Crucial; and the rest will follow.

- Judge of Hell will provide Rapid Parameter Testing Automation without headache, as a helping tool for anyone doing (especially) debugging minishell project; since any new code-modification/s could likely risk something unseen behind each trade-off, thus it would always need another recurring rapid code-balancing/testing to check if everything remains working right from square-one; something which would be severely time-consuming if ever repetitively done - manually; as some forgotten testing parameters during the redo check-and-recheck could lethally leave unprecedented faulties.

- Judge of Hell will stress-test your minishell (without mercy) at the seven(7)-Mandatory prerequisite level with 200+ selected parameters, ranging from the simplest single service requests, to the intermediate level - reflecting exhaustive takes inspired by the infamous Dasha's minishell .pdf compilation, and up-to the most recent Extreme Mandatory-level testing parameters created by several generative . Hence, 'Triple-Fire icon' means 'Super-Spicy' - a.k.a - Extreme level.

- Eversince Judge of Hell will only run by Test-Driving your minishell, you could easily observe the correlation event: if your minishell has severe undetected faulty and it crashed out afterr certain tested parameter/s, then Judge of Hell would also stop working. You could then spot the output display, what kind of testing parameter that causes such logical crash to your minishell.  

- Your Minishell Exit Signal will also be tested against the Standard BASH Exit Signal; thus your exit signal must meet the same Standard BASH value.

- Results from the LIVE Test-Run - including the comparative BASH Exit Signal from your minishell - are Displayed within each of the consecutive testing-parameter columns.

- Per Seniors' Guidance, BASH STDIN output would not be tested - thus your detour, away from any STDIN mode by redirecting it into Error-Handling mode is welcome.  

- Judge of Hell only comes in its standalone binary file to secure the Integrity of all Testing Materials compiled inside - from any possible external breach.

- Judge of Hell only tests input parameters; and doesn't test your minishell History, Sorted ENV Variables, Memory Leakage, *NORMINETTE*-dressings, CTRL-C, CTRL-D, and CTRL-\ hardware-based inputs - which must be tested manually on your own.

- Judge of Hell does not test Bonus Level parts; and does not test your minishell adrift beyond the scope of the instructed seven(7)-Mandatory Built-ins prerequisites: ***echo with -n flag, cd, pwd, env, export, unset, exit.*** Meanwhile, additional operational attributes, such as: redirections, $?, single/double-quotes, *alike* - are regarded as conclusive complementaries. Per recent Senior's advice, and per instruction stated inside the minishell manual .pdf - for us to bear in mind that: *minishell is just a Mini-Shell, NOT a Full-Blown Shell*.

- At the end of each testing, Judge of Hell would appreciate your minishell performance in the form of a comprehensive metric-summary, based on how many successes and fails your minishell did; plus - the projected average percentage(%) score.

- At the end of each testing, all junk files and memory used for testing purposes would be flushed out and cleared automatically. No hangover.

- Judge of Hell was packed with sense of gothic dark humor as part of a relaxing work culture. Feel free to laugh along the way.

- This is where your minishell nightmare meets the real Elm-street from the Twilight-Zone!

From Hell We Salute You: *Cheers!*
